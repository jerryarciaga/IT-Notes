# Kubernetes: The Container Orchestration System
* Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system
* Provides scalability, reliability, and security features for production environments
## Why you need it
### Challenges in managing containers
* Containers are lightweight and portable
* But they require orchestration to function effectively in a production environment
* Manual management can lead to errors, inconsistencies, and decreased availability.
### Key benefits
* Improved scalability: scale application horizontally or vertically
* Increased reliability: automatically restart crashed containers and provide self-healing capabilities
* Simplified management: abstract away low-level details, allowing you to focus on writing code
## Evolution of Kubernetes
### From Google Borg to Open-Source standard
* The Google Borg was a precursor to Kubernetes
## Core Concepts
* **Pods**: define a set of containers
* **Services**: provide networking and load balancing
* **Deployments**: manage the rollout of new versions of your application
* **Clusters**: define a group of nodes that can run pods
* **Nodes**: a physical machine running pods
## Architecture
* **Control plane**: `kubectl`
* **Worker nodes**: run pods and provide storage and networking resources
* **Persistent storage**: provide storage for stateful applications
## Key features
* Scalability
* Self-healing
* Persistent storage
## Use cases
* Web applications: Node.js, Django
* Microservices: Service Mesh
* Stateful applications: Databases, message queues
## Best Practices
* Security
* Monitoring
* Troubleshooting

**Public cloud** is a cloud model where the customer purchases cloud services that are available in the public. The underlying hardware that hosts the cloud resources is managed by the cloud provider.

# Key Characteristics
## Metered pricing
Users are charged based on their actual use of their resources, otherwise known as the pay-as-you-go model.
## Application provisioning
Applications can be quickly provisioned an deprovisioned in the Public Cloud, allowing rapid deployment and changes as needd.
## No capital expenditure to scale up
Unlike private cloud that stores their own data on-premises, in the public cloud, you can always scale up and the prices will adjust accordingly. No hardware needed to purchase for start-up and maintenance.

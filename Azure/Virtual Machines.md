# SSH key pair for authentication
* Most Linux virtual machines that run on Azure typically use SSH-based authentication.
* To create an SSH public-key pair, use the command `ssh-keygen` to create an ssh key pair, stored in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
* `az vm create` is a command you can use to create and deploy virtual machines.

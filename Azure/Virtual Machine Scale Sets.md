**Azure Scale Sets** allow you to create and manage a group of load balanced VMs, providing high availability and application resiliency by distributing VMs across availability zones.

* Think of scale sets as a tool that focuses on availability. When set up, this tool acts like a load balancer as well as autoscale on demand. You can also define a schedule to increase and decrease resources depending on a specified time.

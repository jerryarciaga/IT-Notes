A **subscription** is an agreement with Microsoft to use one or more Microsoft cloud platforms or services. Either a per-user license fee or on cloud-based resource consumption.

This is also a feature you can use to restrict access to certain Azure resources based on departmental requirements. Remember that Azure applies access management policies at the subscription level.

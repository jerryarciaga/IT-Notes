A computing environment that combines **on-premises** datacenters (private) with a public cloud (public) allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

For industries that work with highly sensitive data, such as banking, finance, government, healthcare, **hybrid** may be their best cloud option. This is because this cloud model allows for scalability, that could be leveraged using the public cloud and data storage for certain types of data that could be stored on-premises.

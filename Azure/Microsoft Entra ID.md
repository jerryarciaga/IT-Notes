**Microsoft Entra ID** is equivalent to Azure's Active Directory Service, providing identity and access management to an Azure environment. This allows members within Azure to access provisioned resources whether it's internal or external.

* **SSO**, or single sign-on, allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications without having to sign in on each one.
* **SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)** is the primary protocol used by SSO.
* You can use this to implement strict governance and ensure the right people have access to the right resources. Again, think of Entra ID as an Identity and Access Management solution.

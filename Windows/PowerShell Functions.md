Functions in PowerShell lets you automate stuff. Instead of typing the same commands over and over, you can create a function like so:

```
function Do-SomeThing {

	Do-This
	Do-That
	Do-TheOther
	
}
```

In this case, instead of having to type `Do-This`, `Do-That` and `Do-TheOther`, all you have to do is invoke the command `Do-SomeThing` to effectively enter those commands.
